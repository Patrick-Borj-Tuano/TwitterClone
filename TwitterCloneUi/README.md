# Reflection on Our Website Project

## Accomplishing the Criteria

Our website achieved each item in the criteria through a combination of HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and JavaScript. We utilized basic HTML elements, especially divs, for layout and user interaction. CSS enhanced the design, while Flexbox ensured flexibility and responsiveness. JavaScript was instrumental in implementing functionalities such as API integration and dynamic content updates.

## Incorporating Class Concepts

Throughout our website, you can see elements of all the topics discussed in Module 1. From basic HTML structure to CSS styling, Flexbox layouts, and JavaScript functionalities, we applied the principles learned in class to create a cohesive user experience.

## Design Inspiration

Our primary design inspiration was Twitter. We aimed for a simple layout with a dark theme to prioritize user interaction and ease of navigation.

## Content Creation Approach

We focused on implementing intended functionalities before refining the design. Each team member contributed to feature implementation, ensuring thorough testing before finalizing the design.

## Creativity in Design

Our website stands out for its creative use of colors, layout simplicity, and user-friendly navigation. By prioritizing functionality and clean design, we aimed to offer a seamless user experience.

## Deployment

We deployed our website using Netlify, following our professor's recommendation.

## Team Collaboration

We divided tasks based on individual strengths and interests. Paolo handled API integration, while Patrick and Joshua focused on styling and user authentication. Juan implemented posting mechanics and content display.

## Conflict Prevention

Regular communication and GitHub updates helped prevent code conflicts. We held meetings to discuss progress and ensure alignment throughout the project.

## Future Improvements

In the future, we aim to add more complex functionalities such as post replies and user messaging to enhance user engagement and connectivity. We also plan to improve JavaScript implementation for greater efficiency.

## Additional Notes

Prioritizing efficient JavaScript implementation is crucial for enhancing website functionality and user experience.
